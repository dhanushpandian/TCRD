                <td>Based on 'reviewed' (manually curated) human protein entries from UniProt. Data is organized using the Target Development Level (TDL) scheme, categorizing targets based on their level of development, and the Drug Target Ontology (DTO) for a formal classification and annotation of protein families.</td>

    <h3>Key Differences:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope and Purpose:</strong> Each platform has a specific area of focus within drug discovery. BIKG aims for comprehensiveness, AbbVie emphasizes drug repurposing, Standigm ASK concentrates on target identification, and TCRD prioritizes understudied proteins.</li>
        <li><strong>Schema Design:</strong> BIKG leverages a ULO for unified representation, AbbVie focuses on specific subgraph patterns, Standigm ASK uses a five-criteria system for target prioritization, and TCRD employs TDL and DTO for classification.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Specifics:</strong> BIKG provides detailed information on its data model and technologies. AbbVie outlines a hybrid architecture. Standigm ASK focuses on data quality without specifying technology. TCRD's database specifics are not elaborated upon.</li>
    </ul>
