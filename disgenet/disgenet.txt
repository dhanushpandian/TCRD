We cant directlty access the data from disgenet , unless we login .
so i hav downloaded the 4 file and added a script to load them into our db server.

For Gene-Disease associations: 

disease_associations.tsv.gz 		=> Diseases associated to genes from DisGeNET

The columns in the files are:
diseaseId 	-> UMLS concept unique identifier
diseaseName 	-> Name of the disease	
diseaseType  	-> The DisGeNET disease type: disease, phenotype and group
diseaseClass	-> The MeSH disease class(es)
diseaseSemanticType	-> The UMLS Semantic Type(s) of the disease
NofGenes 	-> Number of genes associated to the disease
NofPmids	-> Number of publications associated to the disease


gene_associations.tsv.gz 		=> Genes associated to Diseases from DisGeNET

The columns in the files are:
geneId 		-> NCBI Entrez Gene Identifier
geneSymbol	-> Official Gene Symbol
DSI		-> The Disease Specificity Index for the gene
DPI		-> The Disease Pleiotropy Index for the gene
PLI		-> The probability for the gene of being loss-of-function intolerant, provided by the GNOMAD consortium
protein_class	-> Protein Class identifier according to the Drug Target Ontology  
protein_class_name -> Protein Class according to the Drug Target Ontology  
NofDiseases	-> Number of diseases associated to the gene
NofPmids	-> Number of publications associated to the gene
