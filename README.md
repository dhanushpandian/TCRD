## Overview

The TCRD project aims to aggregate and provide detailed information on protein targets, with a particular emphasis on understudied proteins. This repository includes a detailed comparative study of the implementations and database structures of four different knowledge platforms used in clinical research:

1. **BIKG (Biological Insights Knowledge Graph)**
2. **AbbVie**
3. **Standigm ASK**
4. **TCRD**

## Features

- **Focus:** Each platform has a unique focus within the realm of drug discovery and target identification.
- **Schema Design:** Different schema designs are used, from Upper-Level Ontologies to subgraph patterns and heterogeneous knowledge graphs.
- **Database Structure:** Varied database technologies and structures are employed to manage and integrate data.
- **Implementation Methods:** Diverse techniques and tools are used to extract, process, and analyze biomedical data.

## Key Differences

- **Scope and Purpose:** Varying areas of focus within drug discovery, from comprehensive platforms to specific target prioritization.
- **Schema Design:** Unified representation using ontologies, subgraph patterns, or criteria-based prioritization systems.
- **Database Specifics:** Detailed information on data models and technologies varies, with some platforms emphasizing data quality and others providing specific technological details.
